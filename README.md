# Pizza-Sales-Analysis---SQL

In this project I have analysed the pizza dataset and solved beginner, intermediate and advanced level queries. I've utilised advanced SQL functionalities like WINDOWS FUNCTION, CTE's and INNER QUERIES. Also I have modified the data types while solving the problems which helped me to understand the implementation of different kinds of datatypes. And this project helped me to practise the query processing in MICROSOFT SQL SERVER.

The data set has 4 tables. And they are 
  1. Order_details
  2. Orders
  3. Pizzas
  4. Pizza_types

And these fields have appropriate attributes within them. I'll provide a model view of this data set, which I developed from the POWERBI DESKTOP. This helps to purely understand the relationship between different fields of the Pizza data set.
